I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at The Ohio State University, specializing in morphology and African languages. #My research focuses on [brief description of your work and its significance].

My dissertation, titled _Topics in Kihehe Verbal Morphology_, describes the tense-aspect system of Kihehe (Bantu, Tanzania), investigates the erosion of a suffix, and examines how language use attitudes are developing in the area. I am advised by Professor Andrea Sims.

You can find my CV [here](/cv/), and my research publications [here](/publications/).

Other things I am involved in:
- compiling a dictionary of Kihehe
- collaborating with Simon Msovela on negation in Kihehe
- looking at change in Iringa Swahili with Hannah Gibson and Teresa Poeta

The Publications and Talks tabs contain the files associated with contributions listed in the CV (not all CV entries have an associated file on this website. If you are interested in concrete outputs of any particular item on the CV which is not on the website, send me an email!)
